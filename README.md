####Usage:
```bash
kaprekar (intget with at least 4 digits)
```
####Example 
```bash
kaprekar 1234
```
#####Output:
```bash
starting number: 1234 
sorted highest to lowest: 4321
sorted lowest to highest: 1234
4321 - 1234 = 3087
result is  3087

sorted highest to lowest: 8730
sorted lowest to highest: 378
8730 - 378 = 8352
result is 8352

sorted highest to lowest: 8532
sorted lowest to highest: 2358
8532 - 2358 = 6174
total iterations to 6174 is 3
```
