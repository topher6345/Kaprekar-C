===========================================

usage:

  $ kaprekar (int with at least 4 digits)
  
============================================

Example

$ kaprekar 1234

starting number: 1234 
sorted highest to lowest: 4321
sorted lowest to highest: 1234
4321 - 1234 = 3087
result:  3087
===============
sorted highest to lowest: 8730
sorted lowest to highest: 378
8730 - 378 = 8352
result: 8352
===============
sorted highest to lowest: 8532
sorted lowest to highest: 2358
8532 - 2358 = 6174
total iterations to 6174: 3
========================================
